# Waste Management System Using AI

Welcome to the waste management system, a project aimed at promoting sustainable waste management practices using advanced AI and machine learning techniques. This system is designed to help you and your community manage waste more effectively and efficiently, reducing environmental impact and promoting a healthier, more sustainable future.

The waste management system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify various types of waste materials, allowing you to easily identify and sort waste into the correct categories for recycling and disposal. It also includes waste detection capabilities to identify different waste items.

In addition to classification and detection, the system provides information on recycling methods for each type of waste, encouraging environmentally responsible waste management practices. A notification system is also included, allowing you to report waste issues to the appropriate authorities with just a few clicks.


## Problem Statement

Improper waste management poses risks to both human health and the environment, as well as creates a significant economic burden. Without effective waste classification and disposal methods, waste accumulates in landfills and oceans, leading to pollution and resource depletion. To address these issues, I propose a waste management system that uses AI-based waste classification and detection algorithms to optimize waste sorting and recycling. This system also provides recycling methods and educational resources. The goal is to reduce waste generation, minimize contamination, and promote a circular economy that maximizes the value of waste materials.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- python
- OpenCV
- Tensorflow
- Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
- Object Detection
- Streamlit
- pycharm(development)
- Google collaboratory(model training)



## Usage and features


•  Waste Classification: The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to classify different types of waste. Users can upload an image of the waste through the web interface, and the system will identify the material and provide information on suitable recycling methods.
•  Waste Detection: The system includes waste detection capabilities using OpenCV or other computer vision libraries. It can identify waste materials in real-time using a webcam or video stream.
•  Recycling Methods: The system provides information on proper recycling methods for each waste type. This includes details on local recycling facilities or programs and guidelines for preparing the waste for recycling.
•  Waste Reporting: The system features a notification system that allows users to report waste to the relevant authorities. With just a few clicks, users can send an email with an attached image and location details. This promotes community involvement in waste management and supports a cleaner environment.

## Installation

### Install Python:
If you haven't already, you'll need to install Python on your local machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and then follow the steps below


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone [https://link-to-project](https://github.com/aryan098-max/Waste_Detection)
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Waste_Detection
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the server

```bash
  streamlit run combined.py
```
Test the system: To test the waste management system, you can upload an image of waste material using the web interface. The system should classify the material using a CNN algorithm and display information on appropriate recycling methods.



## Future development

•  Enhanced Waste Detection: Future development could focus on boosting the accuracy and efficiency of waste detection using advanced AI techniques like deep learning and neural networks. This may involve training the system with a larger dataset of waste images, utilizing more sophisticated CNN architectures, and incorporating real-time object recognition and tracking.
•  Mobile App Integration: Developing a mobile app could be another key area for improvement. Users would be able to report waste and receive notifications about local waste management activities. Features like geolocation tracking, real-time updates, and social media integration could enhance user engagement.
•  Waste Recycling Guidance: Providing more detailed information and guidance on recycling different waste types is another area for future development. This could include creating a database of recycling centers, offering tips on recycling various materials, and introducing a reward system to encourage users to recycle more.
•  Data Analytics: Developing a comprehensive data analytics platform is also a potential improvement. This platform would offer insights into waste generation, disposal, and recycling patterns at different levels. By using big data analytics, machine learning, and data visualization, it would help identify trends and guide waste management policies and strategies.
